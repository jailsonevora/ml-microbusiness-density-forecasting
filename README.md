# Microbusiness Density Forecasting

A time-series forecasting project that predicts future microbusiness activity in specific regions. Leverages historical economic and demographic data, feature engineering, and advanced regression or neural network models to deliver accurate, location-level density forecasts for policy planning and market analysis.
